# vue-radio

> A mock [Fluid Radio](http://www.fluid-radio.co.uk/) frontend app

This is a project aiming for practicing basic and advanced frontend techniques, eg: HTML, CSS, javascript, webpack, etc.

The website I try to mock is [Fluid Radio](http://www.fluid-radio.co.uk/), it is a very elegantly-crafted website, which has very beatiful layout and interactions, and may encounter some surprise if you wander around the site for a while. :)
Of course, it provides really really great music recommendations, along with some beautiful videos.

Following features are required to be implemented:
* responsiveness
* transition animations
* hover reactions (lots of, you will find those reactions here and there )

The basic tech stack i choose include:  
* Vue.js  
* webpack  

I will try to use as few third-party libraries (javascript, css, etc.) as possible, because this is a project for practicing the basic and the essential frontend techniques.
